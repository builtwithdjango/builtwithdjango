# Built with Django

A list of projects and apps built with Django.

[This site](https://builtwithdjango.com) is meant to showcase the awesome work the Django community is doing. I wanted to create a place for people to have their work recognized, especially if it is open source (proprietary projects definitely welcome though!), and stand as examples for those who are new to the language.

## Submitting a project

You can submit your project here -> https://builtwithdjango.com/projects/new/

## Contributing

If you have any ideas, please open up an issue, and I'll try to implement it when I can.
